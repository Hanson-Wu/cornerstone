DataStax is working on a $50 million deal with Target. They plan on
rolling out fully connected retail B&M stores to get ready for this year's
Black Friday. Because of their high throughput and business use cases,
Target requires a highly available system to track every purchase across
all of their registers in each of their 30,000 stores by region, district, and internationally.
DataStax is their answer but due to high demand of DataStax Enterprise experts,
Target looking to outsource their DataStax Enterprise consultants to
other DataStax Certified Partners. This is where you come in.
