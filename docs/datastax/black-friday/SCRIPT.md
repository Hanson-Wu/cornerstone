DataStax is working on a $50 million deal with Big Box Retail. They plan on
rolling out fully connected physical retail stores to get ready for this year's
Black Friday. Because of their high throughput and business use cases,
Big Box Retail requires a highly available system to track every purchase across
all of their registers in each of their 30,000 stores by region and district,
at an international level.

DataStax is their answer but due to high demand of DataStax Enterprise experts,
Big Box Retail looking to outsource their DataStax Enterprise consultants to
other DataStax Certified Partners. This is where you come in.
