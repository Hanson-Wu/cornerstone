# Metagener

This directory will store all recipes used by different projects as well as the
latest stable build. Feel free to use other recipes for inspiration for your
data generation use case.

In the future we may dynamically build metagener, but for now, we will include
the jar.

Some documentation is available, but is not yet available for public consumption:
